# StellarLog

StellarLog is a new way to explore your GitHub Repository.
A web-game made with **Phaser**, **SvelteKit** and **TailwindCSS**

---

## Features (Rough Plan for Now)

- Dynamic Universe generation
- Interactive Exploration - Like pilot among commits(stars) and branches(galaxies)... IDK which one would suit better, branch as a star system and each commit is a planet??
- Computer UI inspired by **Outer Wilds** like when you visit a new commit, you see it's info on computer's ship
- Retro pixel art aesthetic

## How to Use

- Put in link for your GH repo
- Wait for Universe to be built
- Explore the repo in a NEW WAY!
