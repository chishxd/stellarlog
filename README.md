## Features (Rough Plan for Now)

- Dynamic Universe generation
- Interactive Exploration - Like pilot among commits(stars) and branches(galaxies)... IDK which one would suit better, branch as a star system and each commit is a planet??
- Computer UI inspired by **Outer Wilds** like when you visit a new commit, you see it's info on computer's ship
- Retro pixel art aesthetic
